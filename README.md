# ![ARF](assets/logo.svg)

All the dangerous fun of C, and you can do it in style.

Arf is an extremely modular, minimalist programming language. Its syntax and
structure are designed to make writing a program feel like constructing a
machine out of physical parts.

It uses syntactical indentation and everything must be indented with 8 spaces
(the holy indentation size used in the Linux kernel).

What does arf stand for you ask? It doesn't, its just the sound that dogs make.
So far, there have been no successful backgronymming attempts.

This does not compile code yet, it just partially parses it. I don't even have
a language spec. Basically, don't expect a lot right now. Maybe expect a lot
some time later though.
